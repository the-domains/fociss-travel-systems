# The FOCISS Platform

Imagine a new system that can connect and provide intelligence to all the elements of your travel operation. Not only applicable to the elements that are necessary for your business today, but also to provide you with intelligence and connectivity to connect to those far reaches of our technical world. This sounds like a platform that can not only work today but also take you into the future. Perhaps this allow us to even begin plans for the future, today. That's the FOCISS Platform.

Currently the Platform is being deployed for:

* A enhanced, new generation replacement to mid office QC systems.
* Performing well defined functional transactions across systems.
* Gathering pre trip GDS data and depositing it in a specified database.

What solution can we create for you?
